LightRiver is an online machine learning library written in Rust. It is meant to be used in high-throughput environments, as well as TinyML systems.

This library is complementary to [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river/). The latter provides a wide array of online methods, but is not ideal when it comes to performance. The idea is to take the algorithms that work best in River, and implement them in a way that is more performant. As such, LightRiver is not meant to be a general purpose library. It is meant to be a fast online machine learning library that provides a few algorithms that are known to work well in online settings. This is a akin to the way [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are complementary to each other.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### 🚨 Anomaly detection

```sh
cargo run --release --example credit_card
```

### 📈 Regression

🏗️ We plan to implement Aggregated Mondrian Forests.

### 📊 Classification

```sh
RUSTFLAGS=-Awarnings cargo run --example synthetic
```

### 🛒 Recsys

🏗️ [Vowpal Wabbit](https://vowpalwabbit.org/) is very good at recsys via contextual bandits. We don't plan to compete with it. Eventually we want to research a tree-based contextual bandit.

## 🚀 Performance
